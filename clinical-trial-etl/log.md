# Clinical Trial ETL Log

## ✅ Setup
- Created CSVs for patients, dosages, and outcomes

## ⚙️ Execution
- Merged datasets using patient_id
- Loaded into SQLite using pandas `.to_sql()`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- CSV encoding issues → resolved with UTF-8
- Duplicate patient IDs → added validation step

## 💼 Resume Bullet
Built a local ETL pipeline simulating clinical trial data using Python and SQLite, demonstrating data modeling, transformation, and ingestion for biopharma analytics.
